# Okay, enough plagiarism (until later)

I totally just jacked that from [http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/) Coffeescript is just a different way to write javascript. It adds some nice syntax sugar and extra features, but compiles down to nice, semi-colon filled javascript which can then be effectively minimized, or whatever.
